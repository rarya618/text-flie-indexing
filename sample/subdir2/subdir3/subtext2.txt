The rule for working out prime numbers is really simple,
but no one has ever worked out a simple formula for telling
you whether a very big number is a prime number or what the
next one will be. If a number is really, really big, it can
take a computer years to work out whether it is a prime number.

Prime numbers are useful for writing codes and in America they
are classed as Military Material and if you find one over 100
digits long you have to tell the CIA and they buy it off you
for $10,000. But it would not be a very good way of making a living.

Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the
patterns away. I think prime numbers are like life. They are
very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if
\you spent all your time thinking about them.
